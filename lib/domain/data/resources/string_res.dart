- Swipe the board to slide all the tiles in any direction (Up, Down, Left, or Right).\n
- When two matching Addition tiles collide, they merge into one tile. The new tile’s value is the sum of the original tiles’ values. The new value is added to your score!\n
- When an Addition tile collides with a smaller Division tile, it gets cut in half. Your score is reduced to reflect the cut, so be strategic with which tiles you allow to get cut! (Hint: you can sacrifice your smallest tiles OR block a Division tile with a smaller Addition tile that it cannot divide.)\n
- After each swipe, a new Addition or Division tile is added to an empty location on the board.\n
- In each game, you get five chances to undo your last move. Be sure to use those wisely!\n
- If you run out of empty locations on the board and can no longer match neighboring cells, you lose! The goal is to beat your highest score!''';
